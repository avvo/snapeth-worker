# Snapeth

Have you witnessed a teammate or coworker doing something inclusive?

Would you like to be able to snap your fingers in agreement to promote and reinforce those positive behaviors?

Snapeth originated as an Avvo Hackathon project and is GOOD TO GO.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `snapeth` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:snapeth, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/snapeth](https://hexdocs.pm/snapeth).

## Possible Improvements

We should be able to use slash commands (e.g. /snapeth [person] [props description]) if we follow steps [here] (https://bendyworks.com/blog/building-a-slackbot-in-elixir-part-1).
